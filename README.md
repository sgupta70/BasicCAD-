## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching 
* constructions lines 
* dimensions 
* extruding both add and remove 
* linear patterns 

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Mount

### Description

The next thing we had to do was making the mount on top of the base. The dimensions of the mount was 120 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick. It needed 4 holes, I used the same ones as the base (10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge).

### Reflection

I learned how to 
* choose already existing things and build on top 
* extrude 

When I first started making the mount I was trying to do the whole thing seperatly. I was trying to put in all the dimensions for the holes again. I later got help from Mr. Helmstetter and he showed me how to build the mount right on top of the base.

## Fork

### Description

For the fork we had to sketch a circle which was 80 mm and 8 mm thick. Then we had to create a rectangle which was 15 mm x 5 mm, and 75 mm thick. Then two circles one 15 mm the other 20 mm, and 60 mm thick.

### Reflection

[I followed along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQlTfOw8rYQ&feature=emb_logo) I learned about 
* mirroring 
* using fillets 
* extruding 

This was super fun to make, it wasn't too hard for me.

## Tire

### Description

This assignment was to create the tire for the caster. We had to make a shape and then learn how to revolve it around a line.

### Reflection

[I followed along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReEGioIYSus&feature=emb_logo) I learned how to 
* sketch a trapezoid 
* use constuction lines 
* revole the sketch 
* use fillet
